	<h2>Object of the Game</h2>
	<p>
		In Dead of Winter, players are a colony of survivors trying to survive
		a hardous winteer in the aftermath of the zombie apocalypse. <br>The
		colony has an objective they are trying to complete, but each player
		also controls a group <br>of survivors that has a secret
		objective. Often this secret objective requires that a player help
		complete the colony <br>objective. Only players who have
		completed their secret objective when the game ends will win. The game
		can end <br>in a variety of ways: If the morale track reaches 0,
		if the round track reaches 0, or if the main objective is completed.
